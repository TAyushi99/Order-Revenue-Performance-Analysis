## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing transactional order data to evaluate revenue performance, customer purchasing behavior, and regional trends. The analysis is designed to support business stakeholders with data-driven insights for improving growth, retention, and operational decision-making.

---

## Business Objective
- Understand order and revenue trends over time  
- Identify high- and low-performing regions and product segments  
- Analyze customer purchase behavior and repeat buying patterns  
- Enable KPI-driven monitoring through interactive dashboards  

---

## Key Metrics & KPIs
- Total Orders  
- Total Revenue  
- Average Order Value (AOV)  
- Revenue Growth Trends  
- Repeat Customer Contribution  
- Customer Retention & Churn Indicators  

---

## Data & Tools

**Data Source**
- Transactional sales dataset (orders, revenue, customers, regions)

**Tools & Technologies**
- Excel (data validation and initial sanity checks)
- Python (Pandas, NumPy for data cleaning and EDA)
- SQL (data aggregation and transformation)
- Power BI (data modeling, DAX, and interactive dashboards)

## Approach & Methodology

### 1. Data Validation & Preparation
- Performed initial data validation using Excel to check data consistency, missing values, and outliers.
- Cleaned and transformed raw data using Python to prepare analysis-ready datasets.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed revenue distribution, order trends, and seasonality.
- Identified key revenue drivers across regions and product categories.

### 3. Customer & Revenue Analysis
- Evaluated customer purchase patterns to distinguish repeat and one-time buyers.
- Assessed revenue contribution by customer segments and regions.
- Defined churn logic based on customer inactivity.

### 4. Dashboard & Reporting
- Designed interactive Power BI dashboards to track KPIs such as revenue, orders, AOV, and growth trends.
- Enabled drill-down analysis for region-level and product-level performance.
